- The AGDR dictionary supports macrons in any field values but they may break the explorer page. This was highlighted when using macrons in Te Reo species names. (raised 02 Feb 2024)

- Ingest feedback for administrators
    - Case of the properties values need to be respected e.g "unaligned reads" should be "Unaligned Reads" as described in the dictionary
    - TSV (containing properties values for a particular node) cannot have any empty columns when uploaded to AGDR
