## New and Improved

- Ability to search by dataset id in the projects page https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery.  
- The dataset ids in the projects page do not include the programme and project id (e.g. TAONGA-00058-AGDR00067 is now only represented by AGDR00067).  
- The following fields have been added to the project details page (e.g. https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery/TAONGA-AGDR00045/)  
    - contributors list,  
    - project description,  
    - dataset name.  

## Fixes

- Collection date attribute has been added to the dataset node.  
- Supplementary files count is now correct in the project details page.
