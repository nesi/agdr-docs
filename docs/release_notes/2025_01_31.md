## New and Improved

- The **Apply for Access** on the project detail page is now updated to support Embargoed datasets.  
- The **Contributors** field on the project detail page is hidden if there is no corresponding metadata.  
- The datasets are in ascending order on the project detail page if they were ingested in the ascending order too.  
- The following URIs are now redirected as followed:  
    - https://data.agdr.org.nz/TAONGA-KAKAPO to https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery/NZ-KAKAPO/. 
    - https://data.agdr.org.nz/TAONGA-TREVALLY to https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery/NZ-TREVALLY/. 
    - https://data.agdr.org.nz/TAONGA-LAMPREY to https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery/NZ-LAMPREY/. 
    - https://data.agdr.org.nz/TAONGA-KEAKAKA to https://data.agdr.org.nz/discovery/NZ-KEAKAKA/.   

## Fixes

- The **Supplementary Files** count and **Aligned Reads Index Files** count are hidden on the project detail page until we are able to calculate accurately their values.
