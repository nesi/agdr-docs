- The AGDR dictionary does not support macrons in any field. This was highlighted when using macrons in Te Reo species names. It may break the explorer page. (raised 02 Feb 2024)

- Ingest feedback for administrators
    - Case of the properties values need to be respected e.g "unaligned reads" should be "Unaligned Reads" as described in the dictionary
    - TSV (containing properties values for a particular node) cannot have any empty columns when uploaded to AGDR
