# Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository:

# Information for Kaitiaki

## What is the Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository?

The Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository (AGDR) is a
secure data facility that stores genomic information
(genetic data) from a range of Aotearoa’s taonga species.
The repository has been jointly developed by Genomics
Aotearoa (GA) and the New Zealand eScience
Infrastructure (NeSI).

When genetic data are placed into the AGDR the data is
assigned a kaitiaki. The kaitiaki are usually the hapū or iwi
who hold mana whenua over the sample collection area.
Kaitiaki may have been involved with sample collection and
research, or in cases where research has been undertaken
without mana whenua participation kaitiaki may be
contacted retrospectively.

The AGDR **is not** an Open Access data repository. Data in
the repository can only be accessed with kaitiaki approval.

## Taonga species within the AGDR

Taonga species data are recognised to include any data
from species native to Aotearoa, and/or any species that
are valued by Māori as taonga.

A number of data sets are held within the repository,
including some of Aotearoa’s well known taonga species
such as kākāpō and crimson glory mānuka. Requests for
accessing kākāpō data are approved by Ngāi Tahu as the
assigned kaitiaki, with support from the Department of
Conservation. Access requests for crimson glory mānuka
are approved by Rangitāne o Manawatū.

## Who can access the genetic data?

Researchers from both Aotearoa and from overseas may
apply for access to AGDR taonga species genetic data.
Any access requests must first be approved by the
nominated kaitiaki before data is released. Researchers
wanting to access data, as well as researchers placing data
in the repository, are expected to engage respectfully and
reciprocally with kaitiaki Māori, in a manner that respects
the rights and protections provided by Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

## What is the process for data access requests?

- Researchers who wish to access specific taonga species
    data submit an access request through the AGDR
    webpage. The request form includes a number of
    questions about what the data will be used for and how it
    will be used. Questions also include those related to
    cultural considerations.
- The access request is first assessed for completeness by
    staff from NeSI and Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository.
    If the request has insufficient information for kaitiaki to
    assess the application, the request will be returned to the
    researcher. If the application appears complete it will be
    forwarded to the nominated kaitiaki for their
    consideration.
- Kaitiaki assess the request application and may approve
    or deny data access, or may approve with imposed
    conditions. Kaitiaki may seek further information from the
    researcher before making a decision. NeSI and
    Genomics Aotearoa staff are happy to assist kaitiaki with
    any questions they may have.
- If a researcher’s request is approved, data access is
    permitted for a specific period of time (usually this is for
    **one year** ). Should researchers require further access to
    the data they must reapply for permission.

## What does the kaitiaki role involve?

Expectations of hapū or iwi organisations that hold
kaitiakitanga over AGDR taonga species data include:

- Providing up to date kaitiaki contact details.
- The ability (and mandate) to make decisions on behalf of
    the nominated kaitiaki organisation (hapū, iwi, whānau or
    other rōpū). This may involve one person nominated as
    decision-maker, but often an individual will communicate
    information between the wider kaitiaki rōpū and AGDR
    staff.
- The decision-making process is entirely in the hands of
    those holding kaitiakitanga over the data set - no data are
    made available to the requestor until the kaitiaki contact
    indicates that the request has been approved.
- If there is significant time involved in assessing data
    access requests, kaitiaki may charge for their time. This
    charge will be forwarded to the person/organisation
    requesting data access or may be paid by the research
    organisation who collected the data.

## What are the rules around accessing and using the data?

If granted access to data within the AGDR, the default
stipulations are for no commercial gain and no sharing of
data. For situations involving potential commercial
applications, kaitiaki/iwi are welcome to explore the
possibility of benefit-sharing in exchange for data access.
Other stipulations include conditions such as
acknowledgement of kaitiaki for allowing data access.
Kaitiaki may also impose further stipulations.

Both NeSI and GA receive funding from the Ministry of Business, Innovation
and Employment, and the establishment of the AGDR has been paid for as
part of the Bioinformatics project within GA, which is tasked with delivering
infrastructure to support genomic research in NZ.
