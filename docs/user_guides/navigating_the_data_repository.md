## Authentication is not required

Any user can browse the Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository, and project metadata is visible to all users. However, to access the data, you will need to apply for access.

## Discovering Projects

The data in the repository can be searched via the projects page and browsed via the Exploration page.

The project explorer -  "Projects" tab on the top menu, allows you to search by keyword, such as species, author, project code etc. You can also filter using the tags at the top of the page.

The project view shows the name of the project, a brief description, and the Investigator information, file numbers and type, as well as a project DOI.

## Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary Viewer - "Metadata Dictionary" in the top menu, is designed to make it easier to understand the data model, the field types associated with each node, and the potential values associated with each field. It displays available fields in a node and the dependencies a given node has to the existence of a prior node.

- View the Data Dictionary as a graph to see each node, its properties, and its relationships.
Relationships between nodes are represented by arrows from one node to another.

- View the Data Dictionary as a table to see the name and a brief description of each node, organised by node category. Click on the name of a node to display more information about its properties.

The metadata dictionary is under review and we would appreciate feedback.
