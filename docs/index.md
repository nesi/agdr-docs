# [Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository](https://data.agdr.org.nz/){:target="_blank"}

The Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository provides secure within-nation storage, management and sharing of non-human genomic data generated from biological and environmental samples originating in Aotearoa New Zealand. This resource has been developed to follow the principles of Māori Data Sovereignty, and to enable kaitiakitanga (guardianship), so that iwi, hapū and whānau (tribes, kinship groups and families) can effectively exercise their responsibilities as guardians over biological entities that are taonga (precious or treasured).  
While the repository is designed to facilitate the sharing of data — making it findable by researchers and interoperable with data held in other genomic repositories — the decision-making process regarding who can access the data is entirely in the hands of those holding kaitiakitanga over each data set.

More information about the design and operating principles of the Aotearoa Genomic Data Repository can be found in our recent publication: [doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13866](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13866){:target="_blank"}.

The repository has been jointly developed by Genomics Aotearoa and NeSI, and is an evolving project to which we are still adding functionality, so you will see ongoing improvements as we implement new features.
